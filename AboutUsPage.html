            <h3>Tariq Y.</h3>
            <p>Fourth Year CS Major</p>
            <p>I'm not much of a car guy—my dream car is the <strong>Supra</strong>, Why? Because it looks like a sports car that could outrun my procrastination!</p>
            <p>My friends often joke that my idea of a “car enthusiast” is someone who can correctly identify the difference between a sedan and an SUV. but let's be honest, my knowledge of cars extends only as far as knowing how to put gas in them! If you see me behind the wheel, just know I'm probably lost or trying to figure out how to turn on the wipers!</p>
        
            <h3>Muayad W.</h3>
            <p>Fourth Year CS Major</p>
            <p>I like trucks—big and huge trucks to compensate for what I don't have! My dream vehicle is the <strong>Anger Management Monster Truck</strong>.</p>
            <p>Why monster trucks? Because who wouldn't want to crush the competition (or a few small cars) on their way to class? My favorite pastime is imagining my monster truck taking a leisurely stroll through traffic, and everyone else parting like the Red Sea. Just remember, if you see me on the road, be prepared to be either impressed or utterly terrified!</p>
        
            <h3>Syed A.</h3>
            <p>Fourth Year CS Major</p>
            <p>When it comes to cars, I'm the self-proclaimed Car Guru of the group. I drive a <strong>Suzuki Mehran</strong>, which I like to call my "Adventurous Couch" because it can fit my entire family and their luggage, plus a few stray chickens on road trips!</p>
            <p>Driving my Mehran is less about speed and more about excitement—especially when it breaks down in the middle of nowhere. It's a fun way to make new friends... like the local goat herders who have to help me push it! I always say, if you haven't experienced the thrill of a Mehran breakdown, are you even living?</p>
        
            <h3>Adam Y.</h3>
            <p>Fourth Year CS Major</p>
            <p>I'm the proud owner of the <strong>Toyota Hilux</strong>, or as I like to call it, the "Banana Mobile." It's the only car that can hold an entire banana plantation and still have space for my friends on our wild adventures.</p>
            <p>I've mastered the art of parallel parking it in spaces so tight that even bananas would feel cramped! Plus, I always keep a stash of bananas in the glove compartment—emergency fuel, you know? Life is ripe when you’re cruising in the Banana Mobile, tossing snacks out the window like confetti!</p>
        
            <h3>Tareq F.</h3>
            <p>Fourth Year CS Major</p>
            <p>I'm the proud owner of a <strong>BMW 7 Series</strong>, which I refer to as my "Luxury Chariot."</p>
            <p>I like to think of myself as the king of the road—until I remember that my car has more gadgets than I can operate! My favorite feature? The heated steering wheel, because who wouldn’t want to feel like a royal while driving through the city? My friends joke that the only thing I know about the car's performance is how to crank up the volume on the stereo. If you need someone to show off their ride, I’m your guy. Just don’t ask me to change a tire!</p>
